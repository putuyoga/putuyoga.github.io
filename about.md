I’m a software engineer with 10+ years of professional experience. I currently work at a Singapore-based tech startup. My days are packed with planning, meetings, and, of course, a whole lot of coding (shocking, I know 🤯).

Outside of work, I run before the day kicks off. I still game, but not as much as I used to (adulting, am I right?). 

I’m also into investing, traveling, and lately, experimenting with LLMs. What else? I’m always up for discovering what life throws my way!

If you are interested in my professional journey, go check out my [resume](/resume) or [portfolios](/portfolios) page instead. 

Cheers,
