title: About Me
---

I have been developing software since I was a kid, who spent his free time tinkering with his father's computer until it was broken.

My journey started with `php`, `css`, `html`, and ugly `javascript` on notepad++ while listening to winamp, I felt I conquered the world. Damn, It felt so good at that time.

Now, I am getting paid to smash the keyboard and pretend to work hard the whole day. Heck, becoming an adult, sometimes I am even questioning my existence on this earth as well.


Anyway, If you are looking me for my professional history, go check my [resume](/resume) or [porfolios](/portfolios) page instead. 

Cheers,
