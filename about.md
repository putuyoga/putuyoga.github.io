Iâ€™m a software engineer with 9+ years of professional experience. I currently work at a Singapore-based tech startup. My days are packed with planning, meetings, and, of course, a whole lot of coding (shocking, I know ðŸ¤¯).

Outside of work, I run before the day kicks off. I still game, but not as much as I used to (adulting , am I right?). 

Iâ€™m also into investing, traveling, and lately, experimenting with LLMs. What else? Iâ€™m always up for discovering what life throws my way!

If you are interested in my professional journey, go check out my [resume](/resume) or [portfolios](/portfolios) page instead. 

Cheers,
