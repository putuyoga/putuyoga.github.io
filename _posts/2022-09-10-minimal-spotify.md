Hey, it's the weekend and it has been heavily raining the entire day, so I have nothing to do outside. What then should I do? 

So I made the decision to restore my outdated Intel 2018 Macbook Pro to factory settings. 

It contains a substantial number of unfinished programs, setups, and files. It quickly heats up, making typing on my lap quite unpleasant. My current M1 Pro machine is a great blessing since it is much, much better. 

When I last used this computer, I was using expo to create iOS applications, which, in comparison to my WSL machine, was rather great. 

Speaking about my old Mac, I don't add many programs after a factory reset. I use Spotify to play music while I'm creating code; although it uses more resources, I'd rather use those resources for development. I've been looking about and came upon 'ncspot,' a fascinating Spotify client that runs on a terminal.

With `brew`, you can simply running

```shell
brew install ncspot
```

Run ncspot and login using your username and password.  That's it. 

I must say the interaction pretty limited, but this is terminal right? Haha

Compare with official spotify app, it consume 20x times less memory which is nice! I am still exploring this, let's see what it can do.
