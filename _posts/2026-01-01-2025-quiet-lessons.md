I got promoted to senior. Surprisingly, it still didn't silence my impostor syndrome. To me, senior is just a title.
It means more responsibility, not that I am more skilled than others.

I used to feel anxious about underperforming and disappointing others. Over time, I learned that I can't please everyone, and that's okay.
I learned to say no. I learned not to take everything personally; it’s just a matter of perspective.
I learned to stop, think, assess, and respond. I wish I had discovered this approach earlier.

Time and energy are precious currencies. They're very limited. I'm much more careful now about where I spend them.
I've come to accept impermanence; nothing lasts forever. So I try to spend that currency on things that truly matter to me.

I also reviewed my long-term goals. The boring habits I've repeated year after year finally started to show some results.
Progress came from showing up when my mind is tired or when my motivation is low.
Consistency really does beat intensity.

Earlier this year, I got injured and had to stop running. Recovery took months.
I was too excited, doing too much and too soon. That forced me to slow down.
I learned patience, and to listen to my body and respect my limits.

I learned to pace myself better, not only in running, but also in every aspect of life.
Happy New Year 2026.
