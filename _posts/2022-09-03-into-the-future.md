A lot happened these past 4 years since I updated my site. Now I am back trying to revive this old site, ~~until I become lazy again~~. 

So what's new these past years?

- I accepted a job offer in Japan 🇯🇵 and was living there for a year
- I still work with `react-native` but learned a lot of things too:
    - `typescript`
    - `nodejs`
    - `mongodb`
    - `vue`
    - `firebase` & much more!
- Went back before **covid19** hit Indonesia in March 2020, I was feeling very lucky at that time
- Crazy gaming time the whole of 2020 with my latest gaming rig 🎮
- Bad habits emerged due to lockdown
- Had enough fun and decided to upgrade my workstation setup on 2021 
- Pushed my skillsets further, including but not limited to:
    - `nuxtjs`
    - `graphql`
    - `docker`
    - `AWS`
- Tried to fix my habits, like good sleep, exercise, healthy food, reading books, and so on 
- Pushed life thru uncertainty phase → burnout cycle → barely recover my mental state ⛈️
- Now in 2022, I jumped on Singapore 🇸🇬 based company as a full-stack engineer 🔥
- Going forward, a few fun kinds of stuff I am eager to learn in workplace:
    - `python` and `django`
    - `rabbitmq`
    - `postgresql`

Well, after looking back, I realized sometimes life does not always give you what you want. But I can't wait for what life going to offer as I believe every second in the future is a little surprise wrapped in a different way. 

Now let's stop this nonsense, back to work, and do our best 💻.
