A lot happened these past 4 years since I updated my site. Now I am back trying to revive this old site, ~~until I become lazy again~~.

So what's new these past years?

### 2019 — Went to Japan

I accepted a job offer in Japan 🇯🇵 and was living there for a year. I still work with `react-native` but learned a lot of other stuff too:

- `typescript`
- `nodejs`
- `mongodb`
- `vue`
- `firebase` & much more!

It was both fun and hard time. Not gonna lie, I really miss the food near my apato, すきです haha.

### 2020 — Moved back to Indonesia

I moved back before **covid19** hit Indonesia in March 2020. I was feeling very lucky at that time, seriously, the border got closed after that.

This was crazy gaming time because I got myself a new gaming rig setup 🎮, which lead to bad habits emerging due to lockdown. Unhealthy food, not moving too much, rarely taking a bath. Poor me!

### 2021 — Work, work, and work

Had enough fun in 2020 and decided to upgrade my workstation setup to increase my productivity, It really paid off because this is the time when I was the busiest and a moment to keep my workaholic nature for a while. It naturally pushed my skillsets further, including but not limited to:

- `nuxtjs`
- `graphql`
- `docker`
- `AWS`

This is the period I worked too much which lead to a very steep phase of burnout in the following year.

### 2022 — Reborn

I pushed life thru the uncertainty phase → burnout cycle → barely recover my mental state ⛈️ this year. After some time decided to resign from my 4 years workplace to take a long break and revisit my long-term goal.

Now, I jumped on Singapore 🇸🇬 based company as a full-stack engineer 🔥, Going forward, a few fun kinds of stuff I am eager to learn in the workplace:

- `python` and `django` 
- `rabbitmq` 
- `postgresql`

Well, after looking back, I realized sometimes life does not always give you what you want. But I can't wait for what life going to offer as I believe every second in the future is a little surprise wrapped in a different way.

Now let's stop this nonsense, back to work, and do our best 💻.
