Before getting my ThinkCentre M720q, I first experimented with setting up Coolify on my old Mac Mini 2012. It was a fun experience, but I quickly realized that I needed something with more capability to handle my self-hosting itch. Thatâ€™s when I decided to find the most affordable used mini pc in Reddit, which directed me to the ThinkCentre M720q, equipped with 32GB RAM and a 1TB SSD. With more power at my disposal, I was excited to see what I could achieve!

Part of the reason I dived into this project was that I had to take a break from running due to an injury. But another big factor was costâ€”I realized that cloud VPS services were getting expensive, and running my own server would give me more control without the recurring fees. Setting up my home server became the perfect solution.

## Setting Up My Server
Getting everything running was an exciting journey. First, I set up the operating system which is an Ubuntu 24.04 server and made sure I could access my server via ssh thru my home network. Thereâ€™s something really satisfying about seeing everything come togetherâ€”like piecing together a puzzle where each step makes the final picture clearer.

Networking was another key part of the process. I configured my router so I could access my server from anywhere.

No need to set up fancy stuff like Kubernetes or become a Docker wizardâ€”pun intended! But you do need to understand a few basic things to get everything running smoothly.

## Deploying Coolify
The moment I installed Coolify, I knew I had made the right choice. The interface was clean and easy to navigate, making deployments feel effortless. Connecting my Gitea repository and deploying my first app was as simple as clicking a few buttons. Watching it come to life on my own server? Absolutely thrilling!

It was like having my personal cloud, with all the flexibility and power that came with it. No limitations, no restrictionsâ€”just pure control over my applications.

## What's Next?
Now that Coolify is up and running, Iâ€™m already thinking about what to host next. Maybe a personal dashboard? A self-hosted analytics tool? The possibilities are endless. The best part? I built this all myself, and thatâ€™s an incredibly rewarding feeling.

If youâ€™ve ever thought about setting up your own home server, I highly recommend it. The journey is exciting, and the sense of accomplishment is unbeatable!
