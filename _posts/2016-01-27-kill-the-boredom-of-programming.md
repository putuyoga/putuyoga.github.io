I remember my first programming is around PHP and JS, not fancy but it is all i can do. 
Create my own CMS called _midCMS_ or involved around with a lot of people on open source MMORPG engine Devana whics is dead several years ago.

That is all are fun indeed, even i am noobs at that time, i don't care.
